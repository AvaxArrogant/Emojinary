# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the UI display issue in the Emojirades game where the player list and join/start game buttons are not visible on the initial menu/app screen. Users currently see a blank or incomplete interface when they first open the game, preventing them from joining or starting multiplayer sessions.

- **Initial_Screen**: The first interface users see when opening the game application
- **Game_Lobby_Component**: The React component responsible for displaying the lobby interface
- **Loading_State**: The visual indication that the application is processing or fetching data
