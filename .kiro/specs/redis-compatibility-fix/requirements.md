# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Emojirades Game is experiencing a critical multiplayer flow issue where the leaderboard API fails due to Redis method compatibility problems with Devvit's Redis implementation. The `redis.zRevRank` function is not available in Devvit, causing the game to get stuck when 2+ players are connected and the leaderboard tries to load. This prevents the game from proceeding beyond the lobby state.

## Glossary

- **Emojirades_Game_System**: The complete multiplayer guessing game application running on Reddit via Devvit
- **Redis_Compatibility_Layer**: Abstraction layer that handles differences between standard Redis and Devvit's Redis implementation
- **Leaderboard_Service**: Component responsible for fetching and displaying player rankings and scores
- **Player_Rank_Calculation**: Algorithm to determine a player's position in the leaderboard without using unavailable Redis methods
- **Fallback_Mechanism**: Alternative approach when primary Redis operations are not available
- **Devvit_Redis**: Reddit's limited Redis implementation that doesn't support all standard Redis commands
- **Game_Flow_Recovery**: System's ability to continue functioning when non-critical components fail

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game to use only Devvit-compatible Redis methods, so that the leaderboard functionality works correctly in the Devvit environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL replace all usage of `redis.zRevRank` with Devvit-compatible alternatives
2. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL implement Player_Rank_Calculation using only `redis.zRange` and `redis.zRangeByScore` methods
3. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL validate all Redis operations against Devvit's supported command set
4. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL log warnings when attempting to use unsupported Redis methods
5. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL provide comprehensive error handling for Redis compatibility issues

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the leaderboard to load successfully even when there are multiple players connected, so that I can see my ranking and the game can proceed normally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Leaderboard_Service requests player rankings, THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL calculate ranks using available Redis methods
2. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL return accurate player rankings within 2 seconds of request
3. WHEN Redis operations fail, THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL provide fallback ranking data
4. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL display leaderboard data without blocking game progression
5. WHEN leaderboard data is unavailable, THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL show a graceful fallback message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the multiplayer game flow to continue working even if the leaderboard temporarily fails, so that gameplay is not interrupted by non-critical errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Leaderboard_Service encounters errors, THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL allow game progression to continue
2. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL implement Fallback_Mechanism for leaderboard display during errors
3. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL retry failed leaderboard requests with exponential backoff
4. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL provide user-friendly error messages for leaderboard failures
5. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL maintain core game functionality independent of leaderboard status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for Redis operations, so that I can quickly identify and resolve compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL log all Redis method calls with their success/failure status
2. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL provide detailed error messages for unsupported Redis operations
3. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL implement Redis_Compatibility_Layer with method validation
4. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL track Redis operation performance and failure rates
5. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL provide debugging information for Redis compatibility issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want accurate player ranking calculations that work consistently across all game sessions, so that the leaderboard reflects true player performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL calculate player ranks by retrieving and sorting leaderboard data
2. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL maintain ranking accuracy equivalent to `zRevRank` functionality
3. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL handle tied scores appropriately in ranking calculations
4. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL update player ranks in real-time during active games
5. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL persist accurate ranking data across game sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the game to gracefully handle Redis limitations and provide alternative solutions, so that the application remains stable in the Devvit environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL implement alternative algorithms for unsupported Redis operations
2. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL provide configuration options for Redis compatibility mode
3. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL monitor Redis operation success rates and alert on failures
4. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL implement caching strategies to reduce Redis operation dependencies
5. THE Emojirades_Game_System SHALL document all Devvit Redis limitations and workarounds
