- **Game_Lobby**: The waiting area where players join before the game starts
- **Game_State**: The current status and data of the multiplayer game session
- **Moderator**: The first player to join a game who has permission to start the game
- **Player_Count**: The number of players currently in the game
- **Minimum_Players**: The required number of players (2) to start a game
- **Maximum_Players**: The maximum allowed players (8) in a single game
